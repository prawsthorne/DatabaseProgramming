Brandon, I consider your work COMPLETE. One issue, not too different from other peoples.
2.5 even though your JOIN worked, it was incorrect. the field should be the same name form each table in the JOIN.

2.4 GROUP BY needs to work with aggregate functions of SUM(), COUNT(), MIN(), AVG(), ETC... on a field that would have something to COUNT(), ETC...

4.b Stay away from using special characters in table or field names (#).

2.5 The SELECTED fields should (most times) come from both sides of the JOIN. Including title as part of the fields SELECTED would have helped with understanding.
3.3 You needed a FROM public.customer to make the SELECT work properly
